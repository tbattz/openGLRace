# openGLRace
A rudimentary vehicle simulation using openGL. 

# Dependencies
##  Automated Install
A few scripts have been created to automate the installation process. In the event these fail, you may have to compile the dependencies manually.
### Linux (Ubuntu)
On Ubuntu these dependencies can be installed by running
```
sudo chmod +x installDependicies.sh
./installDependiciesUbuntu.txt
```
### Windows (Windows 10)
Windows has a clunkier installation procedure.
Independices are installed in two steps.
* Run installDependiciesWindows.bat
* Make sure that you follow the instructions to add the correct paths to your PATH variable.
* In a new command prompt (one that will grab the updated PATH), run installDependiciesWindowspart2.bat

## Manual Install
### Linux (Ubuntu)
* Building dependicies
	* cmake
	```
	sudo apt-get install cmake
	```

* assimp (The Open Asset Import Library Repository).
	* Clone into any directory using

	make -j4
	sudo make install
	```

* GLEW (The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library)
	* Install the development library
	```
	sudo apt-get install libglew-dev
	```

* GLM (The OpenGL Mathematics Library)
	* Download a release from Github and extract, https://github.com/g-truc/glm/tags
	* Copy the glm folder inside the glm release into the include directory
	```
	cd <glm_root_dir>
	sudo cp -r glm /usr/local/include/
	```

# Compiling
A CMakeLists.txt file is included for compiling with Cmake. This should work for both Debian and Windows based systems. Navigate to the build directory and remove any old CMakeFiles
```
cd build
rm -r CMakeFiles/
```
Run cmake to generate a makefile.
```
cmake ..						# Linux
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..	# Windows
```
Compile the program.
```
make
```
This may take longer on a Windows based system.

# Compiling an Eclipse Project
To generate an Eclipse project, from the root directory,
```
cd build
rm -r CMakeFiles/
cmake -G Eclipse\ CDT4\ -\ Unix\ Makefiles  ..
```
Then import the project into Eclipse using File >> Import >> General >> Existing Projects into Workspace. Click next and set the root directory to <workspace>/openGLRace/build. Click Finish. The project can now be built with Eclipse using the 'all' Build Target. 

# Models
Rudimentary models are stored [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8WtiKHIU0VNV3l5aDEzdHhkV3c?usp=sharing). They should be placed in a Models folder at the top directory, parallel to src and Debug.

# Run Options
* The -w argument draws using wireframe mode
* The -f argument displays the current fps

To run, navigate to the Debug directory and enter
```
./openGLRace
```
Move around in the world using the wasd keys.

# Making Changes with Eclipse
These instructions are retained to give a manual method for building the project with Eclipse, in the case where cmake fails due to configuration issues.

If you just want to compile the source code without making changes, then running make from the command line, while in the Debug directory will give you your desired result.

* Change the source directory. Project >> Properties >> C/C++ General >> Paths and Symbols >> Source Location. Delete the /openGLRace folder and add /openGLRace/src. This should be done for both the Debug and Release configurations by changing the selected configuration in this tab.

* Add libraries. Project >> Properties >> C/C++ Build >> Settings >> Tool Settings >> GCC C++ Linker >> Libraries. Under Libraries (-l), add each of the following as separate entries. Again remember to do this for both Debug and Release configurations. Note that they must be added in this order or you will get errors.
	* glfw3
	* Xinerama
	* Xcursor
	* rt
	* m
	* assimp
	* dl
	* Xxf86vm
	* GL
	* GLU
	* X11
	* pthread
	* Xrandr
	* GLEW
	* Xi
	* SOIL
	* freetype

* Add the path to the header only GLM library to the GCC C++ Compiler Includes. Project >> Properties >> C/C++ Build >> Settings >> Tool Settings >> GCC C++ Compiler >> Includes. Under include paths, add /usr/local/include

* This project needs to be compiled with c++11. Project >> Properties >> C/C++ Build >> Settings >> Tool Settings >> GCC C++ Compiler >> Miscellaneous. Under the Other flags box, add -std=c++11. Eclipse will build the project but may still show errors. To fix this, go to Project >> Properties >> C/C++ General >> Preprocessor Include Paths, Macros etc. >> Providers. Locate CDT GCC Built-in Compiler Settings. Uncheck the "Use global provider shader between project" box, and append -std=c++0x to the "Command to get compiler specs:" entry box. Move this entry to the top of the list using Move Up. Apply and click ok. Then re-resolve the includes using Project >> C/C++ Index >> Re-resolve Unresolved Includes.
